## Exercise: Fizz Buzz

Write a program that implements the "Fizz Buzz" algorithm, defined as follows:

for i from 1 to 15 
    if i is divisible by 3 and 5
        print "fizz buzz"
    otherwise if i is divisible by 3
        print "fizz"
    otherwise if i is divisible by 5
        print "buzz"
    otherwise
        print i

Hint: you'll need to use the integer modulo
operator (%) and the logical AND operator (&&).
