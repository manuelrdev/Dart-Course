## Exercise: if/else statement

Define two integer variables called `netSalary` and `expenses`.

Then write a program that prints different sentences depending on these conditions: 

if netSalary > expenses 
    you have saved $(netSalary-expenses) this month
otherwise if expenses > netSalary
    you have lost $(expenses - netSalary) this month
otherwise
    Your balance hasn't changed

Then verify that the program works correctly for different values of `netSalary` and `expenses`.
